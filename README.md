# GalaxiesBeyondtheWorld
An __unfinished__ planet pack for Kerbal Space Program (KSP)

Create planets based on Universe Sandbox 2, simulate orbital mechanics, and "export"(by taking screenshots) terrain maps.

Now, there are only the planet where Kerbals lives and the sun in the solar system where it is located.

This version is tested under Kopernicus 1.9.1-1 and Module Manager 4.1.3.
